### Intro to Software Engineering

**Course Description:** This course covers the basics of software engineering, including collaborative software development, 
project management, design patterns, and software testing.

**Course Objectives:**
1. Explain software engineering fundamentals
2. Develop use-cases and use-case diagrams to elicit software requirements using a current modeling tool
3. Analyze and design software systems using object oriented techniques
4. Develop code by applying proper object oriented coding techniques and applying suitable design patterns
5. Perform functional and unit testing of software systems using state of the art testing tools and techniques
6. Follow a disciplined software process model in developing a software product
7. Work effectively on a software development team
8. Effectively communicate among stake-holders using technical documents and oral presentations

This course is project based. There are still quizzes and exams, but a majority of your time will be spent on the course project, which
has both individual and small-group (4 person) components. Your group will be the same all semester.


### Useful Tools
These are some of the tools that are useful for this course (contributions welcome!)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) - A distributed source control system that simplifies collaboration on large software projects. 
The class doesn't cover Git, but knowing it will make working on the projects easier.
- [UML (free code camp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/uml-diagrams-full-course/) - A resource to help digest UML diagrams.

### Student Reviews

- **Review 1**: "This course is one of the most valuable you're gonna take at ASU. It's also really annoying since the quality of your group is entirely up to luck. If you've never worked on a group project 
before this class, learn Git, trust me."
