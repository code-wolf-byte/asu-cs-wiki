## writing a goated resume

I think there's a million resources on this out there, so ill keep it short:
- Ask Claude (still better at writing than ChatGPT) to roast your resume constructively, it'll unlock so much improvement
- People often stuff their resume with numbers (correct form), but bad ones (wrong content). Make the stats something people care about.
  - **BAD:** Optimized my hackathon project backend to 99.99% availability and &lt;1ms latency (P99). 
    - This has absolutely 0 impact on the world, and the recruiter can tell no one uses your hackathon project anymore. Probably best to just delete this point (or even the whole project) entirely
  - **BETTER:** Automated 40hrs/week [or $$ equivalent] of manual validation by implementing evil AI system with XYZ tech stack
    - Good business impact!
- I occassionally get inspiration from [resumes.fyi](https://resumes.fyi/explore), a crowdsourced collection of resumes and the companies they've gotten interviews at. Just take everything with a grain of salt; no verification means that the resumes can either be fake, or they're lying about the companies

## cold applying

- Sadly, for those of us that can't nepo into somewhere (i would if i could), it's a numbers game
- The best you can do is keep track of openings (subscribe to listings like [Simplify's](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2026-Internships) (disclaimer: they have sponsored SoDA in the past) or [the infamous CSCD server's](https://github.com/vanshb03/Summer2026-Internships)) and applying ***the day*** they come out.
  - Not to inspire anxiety, but the last point is important to be consistent with. if you apply even a day after, you'll have been beaten by thousands of applicants
- Referrals are a hit or miss at larger, more established tech companies (think FAANG/MANGO/whatever tier). get them if you can but don't get your hopes up

## surviving online assessments (OAs)

- These are annoying, but companies do it to save wasting their interviewers' time with people who GPTed through 310.
  - Let us know if you have a positive experience using Cluely, but my hunch is that you will embarass yourself.
- To prep, all you need is [cracking the coding interview](https://github.com/md-arfin-cse/Coding-Books/blob/master/Cracking%20the%20Coding%20Interview%206th%20Edition.pdf) and [Neetcode 150](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/rr2ss0g5/). 
  - These take a long time to get through, so you don't have to do these 100% to pass a technical. And you don't get cracked by cramming these like a test. This is a long-term process, like going to the gym.
- Use Leetcode Premium to view the specific questions asked by a company you're interviewing with. Hit up the Hacker Devils discord (see [Student Organizations](/guides/clubs)) if you want to be hooked up for free
  - There are also ripped copies of the company leetcode lists out there, though they might be dated
  - If you NEED a last resort, absolutely STAY AWAY from this paywalled Chinese-language forum called [1point3acres](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/) that swaps NDA-breaking details on interview questions (behaviorals, technicals), because it's against the law.

### CodeSignal ICF & GCA

This is a standardized test used by many tech companies. These are like the ACT/SAT of OAs. Nice thing is that if you ace one with a 600/600, you can reuse it for other ICF/GCA companies and skip their OA altogether. The part that sucks is that there's cooldowns: Limit of 3 assessment attempts in a 180 day window, with at most 2 attempts in 30 days [[source](https://support.codesignal.com/hc/en-us/articles/11635510785047-What-is-a-cooldown-period-and-how-does-it-impact-my-ability-to-take-an-assessment)].

The GCA (general coding assessment) is just leetcode-style questions. Here's a [fantastic deep dive on the GCA](https://github.com/Leader-board/OA-and-Interviews/blob/main/Online%20Assessments.md#codesignal) about what to expect, as well as some practice questions. And [here's a list of GCA companies](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y8d4q5/codesignal_companies_2023_summer/) (last updated 2023 but still mostly accurate). 

The ICF (industry coding framework), unlike the GCA, consists of implementing business logic in an OOP class over 4 increasingly-difficult stages. Ramp and Dropbox are the big ones that use this. Strategy: Don't care about optimization, target solutions clean enough to be extensible in later stages, and get to stage 4/4 ASAP, because that will take up the most time.

## giving behaviorals

- You can use [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) to gauge what kinds of things a company will ask
- In general, hone your STAR story-telling skills, practice with a good partner, and it'll eventually click forever, like learning how to ride a bike
